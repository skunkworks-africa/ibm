- Pak
- for
- Watson
- AIOps
- is
- a
- carrier-class

- It
- collects
- and
- consolidates
- events
- and
- alarms
- from
- a
- wide
- variety
- of
- IT
- environments
- in
- real
- time.
- These
- include
- servers,
- mainframes,
- Windows
- systems,
- applications,
- circuit
- switches,
- voice
- switches,
- IP
- routers,
- SNMP
